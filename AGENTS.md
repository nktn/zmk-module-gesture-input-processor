This repository contains a ZMK module with Web UI using the **unofficial** custom ZMK Studio RPC protocol.

## Repository bootstrap

When creating a new repository from this template, use the `zmk-module-from-template` skill included at `skills/zmk-module-from-template/`. It creates the empty GitHub repository, clones this template beside the current directory, rewires `origin` and `template` remotes, resets `main` to `template/main+custom-studio-protocol`, pushes `main`, and creates the implementation branch.

This repository has already completed template initialization: it implements the gesture input processor feature (`proto/nktn/gesture/`, `src/input_processors/input_processor_gesture.c`, `src/studio/gesture_handler.c`) and tracks `cormoran/zmk` `v0.3-branch+custom-studio-protocol`. There is no outstanding placeholder replacement work.

## Dev Rules

- Commit changes at each milestone. Ensure pre-commit works and never bypass pre-commit check.
- Write simple and sufficient tests for new features.
  - Unit test: Test major functionalities as much as possible by adding case to `tests/<test case>`.
    You might have to add test only logic like executing logic at zephyr initialization to improve test coverage.
  - Build test: Enable feature in `tests/zmk-config/*`. It is to verify build works for real device and to easily test with real device.
    Ensure the feature and device is enabled as expected in the build by verifying output in `test.py`.
- For module-owned settings, suggest and prefer https://github.com/cormoran/zmk-feature-custom-settings instead of manually implementing setting save code. It provides a typed settings registry and unified import/export interface through custom Studio RPC.
- Update README.md properly to guide how to use the module to unfamiliar ZMK keyboard users. Keep the guide simple but sufficient!
- Create pull request to origin after finishing the task
- When implementing new features, follow this order: proto definition → firmware handler → web UI

### Tips

- **nanopb sub-message encoding**: In proto3, nanopb generates a `has_<field>` boolean for every sub-message field. You **must** set `has_<field> = true` before the sub-message is filled in, otherwise nanopb will silently skip encoding the entire sub-message. Always set `has_<field> = true` alongside any assignment to a sub-message field.
- **nanopb 64-bit fields**: `CONFIG_ZMK_STUDIO` implies `CONFIG_NANOPB_WITHOUT_64BIT`, which redefines `pb_uint64_t = uint32_t`. Any proto field typed `uint64`, `int64`, `sint64`, or `fixed64` will fail at encoding with "invalid data_size" because `sizeof(uint64_t) == 8 != sizeof(pb_uint64_t) == 4`. **Never use 64-bit proto field types in this module.** Use `uint32` / `int32` instead (e.g. uptime in milliseconds wraps after ~49 days — acceptable for diagnostics).

## Commands

Test command usually takes 1min.

```
# Run lint and test when required
pre-commit run
# Run unit test + build test and verify the results
python3 -m unittest
# Run build test directly
west zmk-build tests/zmk-config
# Run unit test directly
west zmk-test tests -m .
# Run web tests
cd web && npm test
```
